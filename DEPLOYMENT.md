# 🚀 Docker Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Options (No Local Building Required)

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add production Dockerfile"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Docker Hub Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add secrets:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password/token

3. **Automatic Build:**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and push to Docker Hub
   - Image will be available as: `your-username/ros2-self-driving-car:latest`

### Option 2: Docker Hub Automated Builds

1. **Connect GitHub to Docker Hub:**
   - Go to Docker Hub → Create Repository
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select this repository
   - Set build rules:
     - Source: `main` branch
     - Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.production`
     - Tag: `latest`

2. **Trigger Build:**
   - Push any change to trigger automated build
   - Docker Hub will build the image for you

### Option 3: Remote Server Build

1. **On your Ubuntu server:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t your-username/ros2-sdc:latest .
   docker push your-username/ros2-sdc:latest
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Deployed Image

### On Ubuntu Server:
```bash
# Pull and run
docker pull your-username/ros2-self-driving-car:latest
docker run -it --name ros2-sdc your-username/ros2-self-driving-car:latest

# Inside container:
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
source /workspace/install/setup.bash
ros2 run self_driving_car_pkg computer_vision_node
```

### Expected Results:
- ✅ No OpenCV contour errors
- ✅ No Qt/GUI errors  
- ✅ Clean startup and execution
- ✅ ROS2 Foxy environment working

## 📋 Key Differences from Original

- **ROS2 Foxy** (instead of Humble) - matches working image
- **Fixed package versions** - prevents dependency conflicts
- **Optimized layers** - faster builds and smaller size
- **Production ready** - no development tools

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you still get errors:
1. Check the image was built with `Dockerfile.production`
2. Verify ROS2 Foxy is being used: `echo $ROS_DISTRO`
3. Ensure workspace is sourced: `source /workspace/install/setup.bash`

## 🌐 Ready for Production

This Dockerfile is based on the exact working image structure and should eliminate all the errors you were experiencing. The image will be stable and ready for deployment on any Ubuntu server.
